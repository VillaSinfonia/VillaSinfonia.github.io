## Patrice May, Violin

As a toddler, Patrice was entertained by her mother Joyce's practicing (Wieniaski, Paganini, Chausson, Saint-Saens) during afternoon naps and late at night while her Dad was at school. An advantage of being the first child was her mother's undivided attention in those first years, which focused on singing and piano playing. At age eight, while living in the Central Valley, she began studying the violin with Alexander Vdovoin, and then Severin Saphir in Berkeley. In high school and at Mills College, Nathan Rubin guided her violinistic efforts, while Colin Hanpton nurtured her love of chamber music. A year in London at the Guildhall School of Music and two years at Brigham Young in Provo, Utah rounded out her education. Professionally, Patrice freelanced for a year in northern Germany, joined the Phoenix Symphony for a year, and then returned to the Bay Area to become a member of the Oakland Symphony and various chamber orchestras and smaller ensembles. She played the long-running Phantom of the Opera for almost five years, and since then, concurrently with the birth and growth of her and her husband Robin's twins, has turned her enthusiasm to teaching, joining the staff of the Villa Sinfonia Foundation and building her own private studio in Berkeley. She credits her involvement in music, and the joy and satisfaction that this involvement brings, to her parents, who had the foresight and the willingness to sacrifice all the time, energy, and money necessary to provide a musical home environment and, of course, all those lessons!


## Carol Rice, Cello

Carol Rice grew up in the California coastal town of Morro Bay. She received a B.A. from UC Santa Cruz, where she studied cello with Laszlo Varga and Irene Sharp, her most important cello mentor. Chamber music studies with Heiichiro Ohyama, who later became Principal Viola for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and is now a noted conductor, also had a major influence on her musical development. Carol and Villa Sinfonia violist Gordon Thrupp played quartets together at UCSC under Ohyama's direction, and through Ohyama's friendship with Yo-Yo Ma, Carol had the opportunity to play chamber music with Ma several times over the years and to study with him at a summer program in Texas. She was also a participant at the Piatigorsky Seminar in Los Angeles and the New York String Orchestra Seminar, both full scholarship programs.

Carol did her graduate work (M.M.) at the Yale School of Music, where she met her husband, David Wishnia, also a cellist with Villa Sinfonia. Together, they have been involved with Villa for about 15 years and have had the joy of playing together with their two daughters in dozens of concerts, in venues from Lake Tahoe to Carnegie Hall and Prague. Carol is currently Principal Cello for the Berkeley Symphony, a member of Symphony Silicon Valley, and freelances with other groups.
