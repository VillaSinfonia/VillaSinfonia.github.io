  <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">The Villa Sinfonia Foundation had its beginnings in 1975 when Lynn and Roy Oakley started the Oakley Violin Studio, a private violin studio. Since that time, the private studio has expanded to include other private violin, viola and cello studios in a 501 (c)3 non-profit organization called the Villa Sinfonia Foundation, founded in 1994.<p>
