Sell ads for our programs- For every ad that you sell, 50% of the cost of the ad will go into a tour account with your name on it. The other 50% goes toward our publication costs. Good sources for ads: music stores, book stores, toy stores, doctors, orthodontists, veterinarians, childrenâ€™s clothing stores, car dealerships, banks, grocery stores, record & CD stores, etc. Just present the VSF bio and information flyer or show one of our programs from last year, and complete the concert ad agreement included in this newsletter and return to Lynn Oakley.
