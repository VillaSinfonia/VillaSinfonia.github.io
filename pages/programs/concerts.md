# Concerts

1. The Family Ensemble Concert in October is a big favorite, featuring student musicians as well as other family members who have either dusted off their musical instruments to join in the music making or who are professional musicians delighting in playing along with their offspring. This concert takes place at Ecole Notre Dame des Victoires, 649 Pine Street, San Francisco.<img style="float: right; padding-top: 30px; margin-right: 40px; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 20px;" width="350px" src="/images/cello.jpg"></img>
