<p><img style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px;" width="450px" src="../../images/mountain_spring.jpg" /> Many Villa orchestra members (including adults) have expressed interest in playing chamber music during the year, in addition to Zephyr camp in the summer. So we are very excited to launch a chamber music program for orchestra members, called Villa Chamber Music.</p></div>
        <p>The cost for chamber music this fall through December is $200 per person plus a one-time $25 administrative fee (both non-refundable) and payable to Villa Sinfonia, for 6 hours of coaching. A fee for January through May will be announced in the January 2018 Newsletter. That tuition will be finalized once the chamber music concert is scheduled, hopefully in mid-May. We anticipate that tuition will likely be $450, based on 9 rehearsals of 90 minutes (or 13.5 hours, if coaching sessions are of different lengths). Individual groups may arrange to meet for additional rehearsals, if the students are interested and the coach is available. Scholarships will be available for students who want to commit to the program but aren't able to cover the additional expense.</p>
        <p>Some ensembles will want to meet for one and a half hours, every other week, but others may want to meet every week, for just an hour. Each ensemble's rehearsal schedule and location will be determined according to the wishes of the ensemble members and the coach. Once the schedule is established, however, it must be considered a commitment - as the coach is setting aside that time for the group. (There will be no refunds for absences.)</p>
        <p>We will form duets, trios, and quartets as appropriate, trying to create ensembles for everyone who is interested. A Chamber Music Concert will take place later in the spring for all chamber groups, separate from the traditional Small Ensemble Concert on June 2</p>
