<p>The Foundation's yearly schedule provides a variety of performance opportunities for students of all ages and levels. Among these experiences are chamber orchestra concerts, Suzuki group classes, master classes for advanced players, a family ensemble concert, featuring siblings, parents, and friends, as well as the opportunity for senior high school and college students to perform solos with the Villa Sinfonia Chamber Orchestra. The more advanced students are given the opportunity to play in the Villa Sinfonia Chamber Orchestra, a professional chamber orchestra with its own concert series. Every summer, The Villa Sinfonia Foundation also offers a two week chamber music camp at Zephyr Point at Lake Tahoe. Associated teachers in the Villa Sinfonia Foundation are professional musicians or professional-quality musicians, gifted in their ability to work with students of all ages and abilities.</p>
